These four rivers join up in Guangzhou, flow for about 70 kilometers, and then pour into the South Sea. The section flowing through Guangzhou City is the 'Pearl River' that most people are familiar with. In ancient times, it was called 'The Pearl Sea' for its 2000 meters-wide (about 2187 yards) channel. Later, the channel gradually shrunk, and now it is only 180 meters wide (about 197 yards). Its name is said to derive from a huge boulder in the river bed. This rock, with the name of 'Sea Pearl', is so round and smooth that it looks like a large, shining pearl.",
